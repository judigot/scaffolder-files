In the ancient times, when magic flowed freely through the world, a prophecy was written in the stars. The elders of the Mage Academy had long foretold of a time when darkness would rise, and only a chosen one with the power of light could stand against it.

The prophecy spoke of a young mage, born under the silver moon, who would awaken to powers beyond imagination. This mage would face trials that would test not just magical ability, but the strength of heart and the courage of spirit.

For centuries, the prophecy remained unfulfilled, a distant hope in the hearts of those who kept the old ways. But as the shadows began to gather at the edges of the kingdom, whispers spread that the time was near.

In a small room deep within the Mage Academy, an old mage named Thorin Ironforge studied the ancient texts. His weathered hands traced the words written in silver ink, words that had not changed in a thousand years.

"The chosen one will come," he whispered to the empty room. "And when they do, the fate of all will hang in the balance."
