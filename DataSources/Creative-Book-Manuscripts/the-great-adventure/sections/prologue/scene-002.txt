Aria Moonwhisper stood in the courtyard of the Mage Academy, her silver hair catching the morning light. At eighteen, she was one of the youngest students, but something about her had always been different.

"Focus, Aria," Thorin's voice called from across the courtyard. "Magic is not about force. It's about understanding."

Aria closed her eyes and reached for the power that she knew was inside her. It was like trying to catch smoke—there one moment, gone the next. But today felt different. Today, something stirred deep within her chest.

"Feel the energy around you," Thorin continued, his voice calm and steady. "The air, the earth, the very essence of life. That is where magic comes from."

Aria opened her eyes and looked at her mentor. Thorin Ironforge had been like a father to her since she arrived at the academy as a child. He had seen something in her that others had not, something that made him believe she was special.

"Master Thorin," Aria said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think... I think I felt something."

Thorin's eyes widened slightly, and a small smile touched his lips. "Show me, child. Show me what you felt."
