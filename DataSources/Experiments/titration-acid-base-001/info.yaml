  title: "Acid-Base Titration: Determination of Acetic Acid Concentration"
  date: "2024-01-20"
  researcher: "Dr. Michael Rodriguez"
  lab: "Analytical Chemistry Lab"
  institution: "Chemistry Research Institute"
  objective: "Determine the concentration of acetic acid in a vinegar sample using sodium hydroxide titration"
  hypothesis: "The concentration of acetic acid can be accurately determined through acid-base titration with phenolphthalein indicator"
  materials:
    - "Vinegar sample (unknown concentration)"
    - "Sodium hydroxide solution (0.1M, standardized)"
    - "Phenolphthalein indicator"
    - "Distilled water"
    - "Burette (50mL)"
    - "Erlenmeyer flask (250mL)"
    - "Pipette (10mL)"
  protocol:
    step1: "Pipette 10.00mL of vinegar sample into Erlenmeyer flask"
    step2: "Add 50mL distilled water and 2-3 drops phenolphthalein"
    step3: "Fill burette with 0.1M NaOH solution"
    step4: "Titrate slowly, swirling flask, until faint pink endpoint persists for 30 seconds"
    step5: "Record volume of NaOH used. Repeat for three trials."
  conditions:
    naoh-concentration: "0.1000M"
    sample-volume: "10.00mL"
    indicator: "Phenolphthalein"
    endpoint-color: "Faint pink"
  results:
    trial1: "15.45mL NaOH"
    trial2: "15.42mL NaOH"
    trial3: "15.48mL NaOH"
    average: "15.45mL NaOH"
    calculated-concentration: "0.1545M acetic acid"
    percent-acetic-acid: "0.927% (w/v)"
  analysis: "Three trials showed good reproducibility (RSD < 0.2%). Calculated concentration is within expected range for commercial vinegar (4-6%)."
  conclusion: "Vinegar sample contains 0.927% acetic acid by weight. Method validated and suitable for routine analysis."
  notes: "Endpoint detection was clear and consistent. Method is reliable for quality control purposes."
