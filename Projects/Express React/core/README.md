# Express React Core Files

These are the core essential files that will be included in every generated project.

Files in this folder will be automatically merged with the scaffolded files:
- Core files are loaded first
- Scaffolded files can override core files by having the same path
- Folders will be merged (not replaced)

This allows you to have base configurations, utilities, or boilerplate that should be present in every project.
